#DS-TASK-O1-PRODIGY
PRODIGY INFOTECH DATASCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK-1
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution
Task-01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.
Sample Dataset :- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

Name: World population data

Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).

year: year of the passenger in.

bar garaphs of worls population data.

Fare: The fare paid by the passenger.

Cabin: Cabin number (if recorded)
country code
country name
indicator code
inticator name
("2002")

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

Jupyter notebook

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib for visualization

EXPLOITARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA):

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly. Used descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data

Visualization:

Created a bar chart, scatter plots to visualize the data.

CONCLUSION:

EDA is an essential step in the data science workflow that ensures you fully understand your data before applying machine learning models.
