PRODIGY INFOTECH DATASCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK-02

Welcome to my submission for Task 2 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution

Task-01
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

Survived: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class).

Name: Name of the passenger.

Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female).

Age: Age of the passenger in.

Ticket: Ticket number.

Fare: The fare paid by the passenger.

Cabin: Cabin number (if recorded).

Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED:

Jupyter notebook

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib for visualization

EXPLOITARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA):

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

Data Cleaning:

Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly. Used descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data

Visualization:

Created a bar chart, scatter plots to visualize the data.

CONCLUSION:

EDA is an essential step in the data science workflow that ensures you fully understand your data before applying machine learning models.
